Krenzinator
===========

A bukkit plugin for the Krenzinator gamemode.


This gamemode is mostly a joke, but then again I spent some time making the plugin, so if someone feels like hosting it, go ahead ;) . Or you can just use a part of the code for something else, that works too.
Gamemode description

Krenzinator always mines redstone, therefore 9 redstone blocks can be crafted into 1 diamond to make bloody sure you will mine all of the redstone

Krenzinator doesn't like horses, so mounting them is disabled, however you can still mount donkeys!

Krenzinator doesn't like diamond swords, therefore crafting a diamond sword will result in a loss of 1 heart (armor does not matter).

Krenzinator likes throwing eggs at people, therefore eggs do damage in this gamemode (0.5 heart, is reduced with armor).

Krenzinator likes killing kacperrutka26 and SergeantGnome, therefore if they happen to play this game (and they can be
prewhitelisted if they want to) they will drop 10 diamonds on death.

Krenzinator doesn't like Nether, so it's off :) .

Krenzinator doesn't like skript, therefore this is a plugin.

Nether off and prewhitelisting kacperrutka26 and SergeantGnome are not features of the plugin, but are still encouraged when hosting this ;) .
